# Bike Sales Dasboard
In this project, I conducted an evaluation of bike sales data to gain insights into the various factors influencing customers' purchase decisions. To achieve this, I employed Excel to create pivot tables, allowing me to analyze the correlations among different variables, such as income, gender, education, marital status, regions, and more.

The final dashboard in Excel presents a comprehensive overview of the findings, offering valuable information about customer preferences and behavior. By leveraging pivot tables, I was able to visualize the relationships between the aforementioned factors, helping to identify patterns and trends that could inform marketing strategies and product improvements.

The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling stakeholders to interact with the data effectively. It includes various charts, graphs, and tables that highlight the significant correlations between factors, allowing for a deeper understanding of customer decision-making processes.

This project contributes to the company's ability to make informed business decisions, tailor marketing efforts, and optimize product offerings based on the preferences and needs of different customer segments. The insights gained from the evaluation of bike sales data empower the organization to stay competitive in the market and enhance customer satisfaction.

Overall, this analysis using Excel pivot tables provides a powerful tool for understanding customer behavior and serves as a foundation for data-driven decision-making within the company.
